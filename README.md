Swift implementations of metaheuristic algorithms.

## What is a Metaheuristic algorithm?

Direct from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic) (who knoweth all things):

> ... A metaheuristic is a higher-level procedure or heuristic designed to find,
> generate, or select a heuristic (partial search algorithm) that may provide a
> sufficiently good solution to an optimization problem, especially with incomplete
> or imperfect information or limited computation capacity. Metaheuristics sample a
> set of solutions which is too large to be completely sampled. Metaheuristics may
> make few assumptions about the optimization problem being solved, and so they may
> be usable for a variety of problems.

["Engineering Optimization, An Introduction with Metaheuristic Applications"](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470582464.html)
by Xin-She Yang offers an excllent introduction to the topic, complementing what you might find
on the wider Internet. This reference is mentioned in particular because it provides comparison
algorithms if you wish to validate those in this project.
